Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

on each iteration of code, regardless of what it is, please edit the version in README.md by increasing the last number by one (ie. 3.2-> 3.3) and adding a brief note about what was changed in the changelog section at the bottom of the README.md file, as well as the ?v= query parameter in index.html for css and js files to avoid caching issues during development.
